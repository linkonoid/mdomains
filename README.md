- Front-end: https://domain1.test.linkonoid.com, https://domain2.test.linkonoid.com (static page), https://domain3.test.linkonoid.com, https://domain3.test.linkonoid.com/newajax

## Why is this plugin paid?
- You are guaranteed to receive support;
- You help the OctoberCMS project to develop, as 30% of the payment goes to its development and in no way associated with a benefit for the developer this plugin, because the cost does not cover the time spent on its development
